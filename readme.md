# Regression Models for Event History Outcomes

A framework for regression modelling of event history outcomes using pseudo observations. Current support is for regression models for the cumulative incidence with or without competing risks. Correct variance estimates are provided using the approach developed by Morten Overgaard. Brief simulation studies are provided in under the tests subdirectory. 

This package is in early development. It can be installed by running `remotes::install_github("sachsmc/pseudoglm")`. If you would like to contribute, please get in touch.
